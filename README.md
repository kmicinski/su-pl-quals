These are solutions to the PL portion of the qualifier exams given in
the CISE program at Syracuse University. Each exam solution is written

# ERRATA

We looked these over for correctness and believe they are correct, but
the answers are not formally endorsed by, e.g., the quals committee. Please report any
bugs to Kristopher Micinski (kkmicins@syr.edu) and he will post errata
here.
